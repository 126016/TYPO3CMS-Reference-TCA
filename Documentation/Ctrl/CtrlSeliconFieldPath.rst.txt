--------------------

:aspect:`Datatype`
    string

:aspect:`Scope`
    Display

:aspect:`Description`
    The path prefix of the value from :ref:`selicon_field <ctrl-reference-selicon-field>`.
    This must the same as the "upload\_path" of that field, see :ref:`example in selicon_field <ctrl-reference-selicon-field>`.

    .. note::
        Note this field will be obsolete if the deprecated :php:`type=group` with
        :php:`internal_type=file` are removed. The property will vanish in in v10.
