Verifying the $TCA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may find it necessary – at some point – to verify the full
structure of the $TCAin your TYPO3 installation. The Admin Tools >
Configuration module makes it possible to have an overview of the
complete $TCA, with all customizations taken into account.

|img-84| If you cannot find your new field, it probably means that you have
made some mistake.

This view is also useful when trying to find out where to insert a new
field, to explore the combination of types and palettes that may be
used for the table that we want to extend.
