:aspect:`Description`
    If the evaluation type "is\_in" (see :ref:`eval <columns-input-properties-eval>`) is used for evaluation, then
    the characters in the input string should be found in this string as well. This value is also passed
    as argument to the evaluation function if a user-defined evaluation function is registered.
