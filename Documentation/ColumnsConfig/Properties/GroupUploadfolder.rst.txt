:aspect:`Description`
    **Only with internal\_type='file'**

    Path to folder under :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Core\Environment::getPublicPath()` in which the files are stored, 'uploads/tx_myextension'.

    .. note::
        TYPO3 does NOT create a reference to the file in its original position! It makes a  *copy* of the file into
        this folder and from that moment that file is not supposed to be manipulated from outside. Being in the upload
        folder means that files are understood as a part of the database content and should be managed by TYPO3 only.

    .. warning::
        Do NOT add a trailing slash (/) to the upload folder otherwise the full path stored in the references
        will contain a double slash (e.g. "uploads/pictures//stuff.png").

.. deprecated:: 9.5
   The internal types `file` and `file_reference` have been deprecated with
   TYPO3 9 and will be removed with TYPO3 10. Extensions that used group fields
   with these internal types should switch to use
   :ref:`FAL references <tca_example_inline_fal_inline_1>` based on
   type=inline instead.
