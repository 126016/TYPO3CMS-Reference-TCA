label
-----

:aspect:`Datatype`
    string (field name)

:aspect:`Scope`
    Display

:aspect:`Description`
    **Required!**

    Points to the field name of the table which should be used as the "title" when the record is displayed in the system.

    .. note::
        :ref:`label_userFunc <ctrl-reference-label-userfunc>` overrides this property (but it is still required).
        
    .. warning::
        CType should not be used as this will generate problems during the copy/paste process in the backend, if :code:`TCEMAIN.table.tt_content.disablePrependAtCopy` is not set or set to :code:`0`. Also other field types might break e.g. integer fields. Thus for the label regular input or text field should be used.
