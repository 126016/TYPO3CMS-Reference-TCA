.. deprecated:: 9.5
   The internal types `file` and `file_reference` have been deprecated with
   TYPO3 9 and will be removed with TYPO3 10. Extensions that used group fields
   with these internal types should switch to use
   :ref:`FAL references <tca_example_inline_fal_inline_1>` based on
   type=inline instead.
