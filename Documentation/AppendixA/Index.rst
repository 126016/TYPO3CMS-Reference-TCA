Appendix A â€“ Skinning considerations
------------------------------------

The new reference for skinning is the "Core Skinning Guidelines"
manual. However the reference below has been kept as an appendix since
it contains information that is not yet available elsewhere, even
though a part of it is obsolete. So read it if you are interested but
note that not everything may work as described below.
