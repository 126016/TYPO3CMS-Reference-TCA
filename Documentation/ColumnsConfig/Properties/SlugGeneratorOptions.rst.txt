:aspect:`Description`
    Holds information about the record fields to be used for slug generation:

    fields (array)
      Insert several field names (of type string) that will be considered during slug construction.

      .. note::

        For the time being, only the title field of table pages is evaluated to construct the slug from.


    fieldSeperator (string)
      This value will divide the slug parts. If a section value contains this very value, it will be replaced by
      the value given in :ref:`fallbackCharacter <columns-slug-properties-fallbackCharacter>`.

    prefixParentPageSlug (boolean)
      The slugs of parent pages will be prefixed to the slug for the page itself. Disable it for shorter URLs, but
      take the higher chance of collision into consideration.
