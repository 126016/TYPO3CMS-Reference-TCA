About this document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This document aims to describe the global array called $TCA. This
array describes the database tables that TYPO3 can operate on. It is a
very central element of the TYPO3 architecture.

All code examples used in this manual come either from the TYPO3
source code itself or from the extension "examples", which can be
downloaded from the TER.

This document used to be a chapter inside "TYPO3 Core APIs".


.. _new:
