-----

:aspect:`Datatype`
    string (field name)

:aspect:`Scope`
    Display

:aspect:`Description`
    **Required!**

    Points to the field name of the table which should be used as the "title" when the record is displayed in the system.

    .. note::
        :ref:`label_userFunc <ctrl-reference-label-userfunc>` overrides this property (but it is still required).
        
    .. warning::
        For the label only regular input or text fields should be used. Otherwise issues may occur and prevent from a working system if :code:`TCEMAIN.table.tt_content.disablePrependAtCopy` is not set or set to :code:`0`.
