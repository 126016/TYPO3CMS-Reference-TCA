:aspect:`Description`
    **For the "file" internal type (Optional):**
      A lowercase comma list of file extensions that are permitted, eg. 'jpg,gif,txt'. Also
      see :ref:`disallowed <columns-group-properties-disallowed>`.

    **For the "db" internal type (Required!):**
      A comma list of tables from :php:`$GLOBALS['TCA']`, for example "pages,be\_users".

      .. note::
          If the field is the foreign side of a bidirectional MM relation, only the first table is used and that
          must be the table of the records on the native side of the relation.

      .. note::
          When using Extbase, you also need to fill :ref:`foreign_table <columns-group-properties-foreign-table>`
          property with the same table name as used in :ref:`allowed <columns-group-properties-allowed>` property (but with just one table name).

.. deprecated:: 9.5
   The internal types `file` and `file_reference` have been deprecated with
   TYPO3 9 and will be removed with TYPO3 10. Extensions that used group fields
   with these internal types should switch to use
   :ref:`FAL references <tca_example_inline_fal_inline_1>` based on
   type=inline instead.
