showRecordFieldList
-------------------

:aspect:`Datatype`
    string (list of field names)

:aspect:`Description`
    Defines which fields are shown in the show-item "info" dialog. For example
    'doktype,title,alias,hidden,...'. To see that dialog go to the
    list module in the backend and click on the icon of a record in
    the right pane. Then choose 'info' in the popup menu.

    If not specified, the info dialog shows only a couple of default fields,
    it is good practice to at least add a list of main record information
    fields here.
