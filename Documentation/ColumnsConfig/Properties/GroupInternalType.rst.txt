    Configures the internal type of the "group" type of element.
    There are four possible options to choose from:

    file
      This will create a field where files can be attached to the record.

    file\_reference
      This will create a field where files can be referenced. In contrast to "file", referenced files (usually from
      fileadmin/) will not be copied to the upload folder. **Warning:** use this carefully. *Your references will be
      broken if you delete referenced files in the filesystem!*

    folder
      This will create a field where folders can be attached to the record.

    db
      This will create a field where database records can be attached as references.

    The default value is none of them - you must specify one of the values correctly!


.. deprecated:: 9.5
   The internal types `file` and `file_reference` have been deprecated with
   TYPO3 9 and will be removed with TYPO3 10. Extensions that used group fields
   with these internal types should switch to use
   :ref:`FAL references <tca_example_inline_fal_inline_1>` based on
   type=inline instead.
